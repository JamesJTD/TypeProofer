This will be a tool for making proofs for in-progess typefaces. It currently reads .otf files and creates a print-ready .pdf

After itâ€™s run, it will preview the pdf in Safari. Why? Because I use drawBot as a module and like it that way.

TO USE:

Make sure drawBot is installed (it works with drawBot as a module or in the App)

Change your page size (via the size() variable).

Change savePath variable in proofer.py

Change other variables to suit in proofer.py

Run proofer.py
